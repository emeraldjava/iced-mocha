The Iced Mocha Theme by Event Espresso is responsive, packed with features, and fully integrated with Event Espresso 4. Iced Mocha started as a theme for our Event Espresso test drive website to showcase the power and flexibilty of our <a href="http://eventespresso.com/">Event Espresso</a> plugin for WordPress. 

After using Iced Mocha for a few weeks, we figured that our customers may find it useful for showcasing their own events, so we went ahead and released it on Github. We also feel that Iced Mocha can be used as a good starting point for developers looking to create themes that are integrated with Event Espresso.

##Support and Customizations

This is a free theme and is not currently supported for free. You are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/eventespresso/iced-mocha/issues/new">create</a> <a href="https://github.com/eventespresso/iced-mocha/issues?state=open">issue tickets</a> within Github or ask questions in our <a href="http://eventespresso.com/forum/event-espresso-public/">community support forums</a>, but you are not guaranteed to get an answer without paying for support.

**Paying for Support**<br>
If you would like to pay for support, we request that you please purchase an Event Espresso <a href="http://eventespresso.com/pricing/?ee_ver=ee4">plugin support license</a> and a <a href="http://eventespresso.com/product/premium-support-token/">support token</a>.

**Customizations**<br>
For those of you wishing to achieve more theme customization than what is allowed by the integrated control options, we recommend using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank">child themes</a> instead of manually editing theme files. This feature is pretty well documented by WordPress and has the main advantage of keeping the theme update-able. While any changes done to Iced Mocha's files are lost on each theme update, a child theme is a separate (partial) theme aside Iced Mocha and is not overwritten in any way.
